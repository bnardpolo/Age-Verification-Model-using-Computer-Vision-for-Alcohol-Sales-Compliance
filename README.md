# Age Verification Model using Computer Vision for Alcohol Sales Compliance

## Project Overview

The supermarket chain Good Seed aims to explore how artificial intelligence (AI), specifically computer vision techniques, can assist them in adhering to alcohol laws by preventing the sale of alcohol to underage individuals. The project involves building and evaluating a model for verifying people's age using AI-powered computer vision.

## Project Description

The project entails the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Installing dependencies and loading the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its characteristics and distribution.
3. **Model Training**: Developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict individuals' ages from images captured at checkout, leveraging AI techniques.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the trained model's performance on a test dataset using AI-driven metrics.
5. **Conclusions**: Summarizing findings and suggesting potential improvements, informed by AI-driven insights.

## AI Application

This project showcases the application of AI, particularly in the following areas:

- **Computer Vision**: Utilizing computer vision methods to analyze images and determine individuals' ages from checkout photos.
- **Machine Learning**: Training a neural network model to perform age verification tasks, demonstrating AI's ability to learn patterns from data.
- **Data Analysis**: Employing AI-driven techniques for exploratory data analysis and model evaluation, enhancing insights and decision-making processes.
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning hyperparameters and optimizing model architecture using AI-driven approaches to improve performance.

## Baseline Performance

The initial model serves as a baseline, with a certain performance metric (to be specified) serving as a benchmark for comparison.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate AI-driven metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or others as deemed suitable for the task.

## Results and Conclusions

Findings from the model evaluation will be summarized, along with potential implications and areas for further improvement, emphasizing the role of AI in addressing age verification challenges in retail environments.
